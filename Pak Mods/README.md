# F7 Menu
As it stands right now, the mod requires a World Map item to exist somewhere in the world.  You don't have to keep it with you, but you have to own one.  Since you start out with one, this shouldn't be an issue.
M for Map
Shift + Z to duplicate item under crosshairs
F7 for menu
Menu functions:
 - Delete Items (Checkboxes to delete groups of items from the world)
 - Tidy World (Teleports all items to the back of nearest truck) (Temporarily disabled)
 - Set time of day
 - Free Cam
 - Collision toggle - **Only use when flying!  Be sure you turn collisions back on before turning flight off!**
 - Flight Mode (Shift up, Ctrl down, Z to brake)
 - Teleport via coordinates

Bugs fixed:
Click image on combo boxes

Coming up:

Spawn non-shop items

After that:
